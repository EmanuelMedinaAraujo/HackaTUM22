# StreamFindA - HackaTUM22

## Inspiration
Just wanna Netflix and Chill but already spent half an hour searching for a movie to watch? You are already frustrated and don't want to see the movie even before it has started?  But this does not need to be anymore. Simple use StreamPickA! (The A is for awesome ;) )

## What it does
In StreamPickA you can always decide between two movies or series shown on your Smartphone. After setting some preferences you can simple pick the one of the two streams you like more and click away the other one. After just a few choices you can see the perfect movie or series to watch!

## How we built it
The application has a Django back end and a React front end. We focused on high usability and best user experience. An intelligent algorithm decides on which stream to show next, depending on how long movies stay in your decision and what you did not like and clicked away.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble accessing the data right. The provided data was not in a simple to use format and we first had to parse it to get a good base for good decisions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a nice and intuitively usable app for an easy choice over many different platforms. Helping users to save time and nerves.

## What we learned
The only thing taking longer than choosing a movie to watch, is creating an app which makes that decision easier (yes, we are surprised, too) 

## What's next for StreamPickA
A next step could be a login to save your preferences and improve the user experience even more. We could also imagine  something like a social media component where you can pick streams together with your friends or family.
